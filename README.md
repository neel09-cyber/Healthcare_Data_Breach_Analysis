# Healthcare Cybersecurity Breach Trend Analysis (2009â€“2024)

## Project Overview:
This project analyzes healthcare cybersecurity breach trends over the period of 2009 to 2024, focusing on identifying patterns, vulnerabilities, and key factors behind breaches affecting healthcare entities.

## Objectives:
- Conduct comprehensive data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify breach trends.
- Visualize breach data through interactive graphs and dashboards.
- Provide predictive insights and actionable recommendations.

## Dataset:
- Publicly available breach data from:
  - [HIPAA Journal](https://www.hipaajournal.com/)
  - [PrivacyRights.org](https://privacyrights.org/)
  - [HHS OCR Data Breach Portal](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf)

**Total Records Analyzed:** 6,000+

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Data Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Python Dash
- **Other Tools:** Selenium, Excel

## Project Structure:
- **`data/`**: Raw and cleaned datasets.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for automated data collection and visualization.
- **`visualizations/`**: Screenshots and interactive dashboards.
- **`reports/`**: Comprehensive project report detailing methodologies and insights.

## Key Visualizations:
- Breach frequency and size analysis.
- Common breach types and affected entity types.
- Correlation heatmaps for breach causes and organizational vulnerabilities.

## Insights & Findings:
- [Coming Soon]

## How to use the program:
- install necessary libraries:
    - pandas (pip install pandas)
    - matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
 
- select the plot you would like to see from the menu
- exit the program after done
